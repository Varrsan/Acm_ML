PEPE THE FROG IMAGE CLASSIFIER    

Created a deep learning Tensorflow Framework with the help of knn ml framework to create a classification neural network that can accurately classify whether an image contains "Pepe the Frog"

1. installed required packages
2. imported datasets from hugging face
3. selecting a random dataset of images to train on and display
4. scaled and splitting the datasets into train set, cross validation and test sets
5. building and training the classification neural network 
6. plotting the loss function and accuracy graphs and evaluated precision and accuracy of the results
7. Testing the model against random images and evaluating ybar to predict if the image contains pepe or not and calculated f1 scores.
